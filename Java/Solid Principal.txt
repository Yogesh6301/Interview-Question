ðŸ”¹ SOLID Principles in Java

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help write clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code.
1. S â†’ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Definition:
A class should have only one reason to change â†’ only one responsibility.
Interview Tip:
"Each class should have a single responsibility to make code easier to maintain and test."

2. O â†’ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Definition:
Software entities (classes, modules) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
Interview Tip:
"We can add new functionality by adding classes, not modifying existing code."

3. L â†’ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Definition:
Objects of a subclass should be replaceable with objects of a superclass without breaking the application.
Solution: Separate flyable birds:
interface Flyable { void fly(); }
class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable { void fly() { } }


Interview Tip:
"Subtypes should behave as expected without introducing errors in the system."

4. I â†’ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Definition:
Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they donâ€™t use.
Interview Tip:
"Keep interfaces small and focused so clients implement only what they need."

5. D â†’ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Definition:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
Now, UserService depends on abstraction, not concrete class.

Interview Tip:
"Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations, to achieve loose coupling."
